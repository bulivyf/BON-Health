README — System Resilience Case Studies
Overview
This package contains two components designed to help you understand and visualize how different parameter settings influence system resilience and collapse dynamics:
• 	1. Explanation Video
• 	2. Interactive Spreadsheet
Together, they provide both conceptual clarity and hands‑on experimentation.

1. Explanation Video
The video gives a high‑level walkthrough of the model, the meaning of each parameter, and how the three case studies differ.
It covers:
• 	The purpose of the model and what the “health curve” represents
• 	How each parameter (shock size, recovery rate, decay rate, etc.) affects system behavior
• 	Why the three case studies were chosen
• 	What to look for when interpreting the resulting graphs
Use the video first if you want a narrative overview before diving into the numbers.

2. Spreadsheet
The spreadsheet allows you to experiment with the model directly.
It includes:
• 	Input fields for all model parameters
• 	Pre‑configured settings for the three case studies shown in the video
• 	Automatically generated graphs that visualize the system’s health over time
• 	Side‑by‑side comparison of how different parameter choices change the trajectory
Each case study tab includes:
• 	The exact parameter values used
• 	A graph illustrating the resulting health curve
• 	A brief interpretation of what the curve means (e.g., stable recovery, delayed collapse, rapid failure)
Use the spreadsheet when you want to explore “what‑if” scenarios or adjust parameters to see how the system responds.

How to Use Both Together
1. 	Watch the video to understand the conceptual model.
2. 	Open the spreadsheet and review the three pre‑built case studies.
3. 	Adjust parameters to test your own scenarios.
4. 	Compare graphs to see how small changes can dramatically alter system resilience.
